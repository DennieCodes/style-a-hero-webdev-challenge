# Style a Hero challenge solution

Here is my submitted solution to [Scrimba's Weekly WebDev Challenge: Style a Hero](https://scrimba.com/learn/weeklychallenge/the-weekly-web-dev-challenge-style-a-hero--coe7b4f6e89675e4ad53238f7). #Scrimba

The challenge was to recreate the Hero section as below:

Here is a live link to my project hosted on Vercel: [Style a Hero](https://style-a-hero-webdev-challenge.vercel.app/)

I decided to recreate the Hero image as is but to expound upon the theme and create a home page for this fictious photography course
with details about the curriculum, a student gallery and a sign up section.

The project is built with mobile first in mind and is fully responsive up to full screen desktop browsers. I utilized Sass and BEM to
organize styling the different sections and CSS grid for laying out the card section and also the student gallery.

The images used in the project I sourced from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) and [Pexel](https://www.pexels.com/).
